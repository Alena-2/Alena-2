- 👋 Hi to all Alena browser lovers! I am laying my hands back on the Alena-2 project after so  many years.
- 👀 This time it will not be Visual Basic and .NET anymore. Yet I want to retain Alena's unprecedented speed, portability, low footprint and user-friendliness.
- 🌱 I am sitting at the same desk, and my laptop is 12 years old. So we go penguins this time. I do not plan to make any backend, so I am looking for an open source code in Java, though it seems that I will be forced to start off with C. Then I plan to make my first snap available for download. Alena philosophy will never change. I recommend Vivaldi for those who loved Alena but are not that much resource savvy now.
- 💞️ Like in the old days, the only developer is myself, so I welcome any advice or just a curious user to our future community.
- 📫 Just drop in to my Facebook https://web.facebook.com/litoshka if you are interested.
